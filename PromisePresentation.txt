Promise Presentation:

Topics:
    1. Callbacks
       Problems with Callback:
            1. Can't use return statement
            2. Can't throw an error or catch an error
            3. No stack: as a new stack is created for callback to execute the old stack is discarded

            SIDE NOTE: A function can do 3 things (from a functional programming perspective) and those are:
             a. Return
             b. Throw
             c. Side effects (change the data or send different set of values back)
    2. ES6 Generators
       Benefits:
        1. First-class coroutines
        2. suspend execution context
        3. small api
       Problem:
        1. Not avialable yet
    3. Promises
    4. Async/Await
